## Other Widgets This Week
@yutannihiliation has been prolific this week with a couple new widget seeds and contributions to last week's widget [`metricsgraphics`](http://hrbrmstr.github.io/metricsgraphics/).

- [`chartist`](https://github.com/yutannihilation/chartist) - [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js) wrapper
- [`gneisschart`](https://github.com/yutannihilation/gneisschart) - Gneisschart/[Chartbuilder (Quartz)](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) wrapper

@dcenergy
- [`rflot`](https://github.com/dcenergy/rflot) - [Flot](https://github.com/dcenergy/rflot) wrapper

Not launched last week, but a big miss by me is this `htmlwidget` for mapping from @lmullen.  It was one of the first `htmlwidgets` built after the Dec. 17 release announcement, and offers some nice functionality and interesting examples.

- [`cartographer`](https://github.com/lmullen/cartographer) - [`d3.carto.map`](https://github.com/emeeks/d3-carto-map) wrapper by @lmullen
